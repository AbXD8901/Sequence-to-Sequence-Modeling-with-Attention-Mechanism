# Sequence-to-Sequence-Modeling-with-Attention-Mechanism
The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with attention mechanism. We will train the models on a synthetic dataset where the target sequence is the reverse of the source sequence. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in improving seq2seq model performance.

## Business Use Cases
The insights from this project can be applied in various business scenarios, including:
- Machine translation systems
- Text summarization tools
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Speech recognition systems
## Data Set
The dataset used in this project is a synthetic dataset generated for the purpose of this
project. Each source sequence is a random sequence of integers, and each target sequence
is the reverse of the source sequence.
## Data Set Explanation
The synthetic dataset is chosen to provide a clear and simple example of the sequence-tosequence modeling task. By reversing the source sequence to obtain the target sequence, we
can easily evaluate the model's ability to learn the seq2seq mapping.
